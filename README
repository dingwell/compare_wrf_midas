COMPARE_WRF_MIDAS

This set of scripts is used to create Taylor diagrams for comparing WRF
with MIDAS data.  It is currently working for some fields but not in general.

It does however depend on additional tools which I have not uploaded to github.
I'm not expecting anyone else to use this, but if you find something useful,
feel free to use it. Just don't expect any of this to work without tweaking,
it won't.

The main portion of these scripts are written in NCL:
  The NCAR Command Language (Version 6.0.0) [Software]. (2012). 
  Boulder, Colorado: UCAR/NCAR/CISL/VETS. http://dx.doi.org/10.5065/D6WD3XH5


FILES

list_wrf_files.sh
  BASH script whitch lists input files and set some variables to be used 
  by plot_taylor.ncl

compare_wrf_midas.sh 
  This should include most settings, and there should be no need to edit
  settings in the other files.  There is one exception however, since the
  fields we read from MIDAS data use different units than the WRF data
  these settings are kept in plot_taylor.ncl instead.  Changing these fields
  will require extra data processing or the plots will be wrong!

  One could simply make compare_wrf_midas.sh call plot_taylor.ncl at the
  end of the script, the main reason I haven't done is for faster testing
  of the individual scripts

get_stns.sh
  Tool to extract specific stations from several midas data files.
  The files can be either pure ascii or compressed with gzip, if gzip
  is used, the data will be uncompressed, filtered through grep and 
  written to separate files for each station.  All on the fly using 
  zcat, grep and process substitution.

plot_taylor.ncl
  NCL script to create the actual plots
  Run this after list_wrf_files.sh

taylor_diagram.ncl
  Low level plot function for Taylor diagrams, it is provided by UCAR:
  http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/taylor.shtml
  I've made some modifications to how it handles different colors, changes
  are marked by "AD" in the comments

run_plot_wind_rose.sh
  Tool to quickly plot wind roses for multiple stations

plot_win_rose.ncl
  NCL script to create a wind rose from midas data (should be run by run_plot_wind_rose.sh)

utilities.ncl
  Collection of functions, I aim to put most of the common ncl code in this file
  there is still a lot of work needed though...
